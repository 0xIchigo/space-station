DeFi usually integrate Jupiter for their in-app swap features. They can provide swap feature through **Jupiter Terminal** which allows a simple HTML integration.

Additionally, some protocols can build on top of Jupiter, providing swap & deposit functionality in a single transaction (atomic composability). This enables a user to deposit any SPL token which will be automatically converted by the DeFi protocol to deposit in a vault of any other token. Alternatively, they can achieve balanced deposits in a liquidity pool, for a single token provided by the user or dynamically rebalance their liquidity pools.
