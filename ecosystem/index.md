## Single Liquidity Endpoint For Solana

Jupiter was designed from day one to be the swap infrastructure for Solana.
The main goal of Jupiter is to connect on the one hand users, dApp and program and on the other hand all sources of liquidity of Solana.

Whatever you go through the website, the API or by calling directly the Jupiter on-chain program: you have access directly to all the AMM/DEX that we integrate. We can think of Jupiter as a public good for liquidity on Solana.

## Composability heaven
Composability is the fact that a dApp or a protocol can build on top of another protocol. We sometimes use the analogy of Lego building blocks.

Jupiter is in constant evolution (new DEX integration, added functionality, optimized routing engine). By integrating Jupiter, you benefit from all this work, with no effort, by focusing on your own products.
