# Overview

**Jupiter Limit Order (Beta)** provides users with the simplest way to place limit orders on Solana and receive tokens directly in your wallet when the order is filled!



**Key Benefits:**

1. Users can place an order with an expiration time. At the end of the period, the crank will cancel any unfilled orders and refund the token to the user's wallet. 
2. Limit orders ensure you'll get what you quote with no slippage, which is especially useful during volatile periods. 
3. Transactions will not fail because of slippage errors.
