Bridging non-native tokens between blockchains requires the use of specific tokens for these operations, such as USDCet for USDC bridged by Portal from Ethereum.

The user should then find out where to convert his USDCet into USDC to use them on Solana.

By integrating Jupiter, this additional task can be done in a seamless way for the user and at the best price.
Jupiter takes care of finding the best route and automatically integrates any new pool with sufficient liquidity.
